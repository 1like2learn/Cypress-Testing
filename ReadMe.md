# Module Challenge: Cypress Testing

The module challenge is the afternoon project or assignment that students work through independently. This expands on the guided project completed earlier with the instructor.

## Single Page Applications

## Cypress.io

## Objectives

- explain what end-to-end testing is and its importance
- use the Cypress GUI to write tests and interact with Elements
- use Cypress to test controlled input
- run all tests in without any UI

## Introduction

In this challenge you will write tests with Cypress to debug your forms app from the last objective.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Set up Project

- Install Cypress
- Add dependencies
    ```js
    { "scripts": {
        "e2e": "cypress open"
    }}
    ```
- Write `My First Test` test to ensure everything is working as expected

### Step 2: Write and Run Tests

In order to complete this challenge you will need to write and run the following tests. They do *not* need to pass, so long as the reasons they are failing is legitimate.

- [ ]  Form elements render properly on page
- [ ]  A user can type into the `Name` section of form (repeat for `Email` and `Password`)
- [ ]  A user can check the terms of service box
- [ ]  A user can submit form data
- [ ]  An error code appears when validation fails

Whatever manner most effectively communicates the information (consider whether a specific sequence is required or if illustrating a clear visual hierarchy would be beneficial).

### Step 3: Stretch Goals

If you have time, write and run different tests based on common issues you have encountered working on this code for the past few days.

## FAQs

**What if not all of my tests pass?**

*Depending on the quality of your code from previous lessons, your tests might not pass. That is quite alright! The purpose of this project is to design tests that point out errors. As such, you just need to be sure that the tests are failing because of issues with your web page code, not issues with your test code.*
